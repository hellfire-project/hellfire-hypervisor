/* 
 * This is the configuration sample for the coremark benchmark. 
 * 
 * For generante a system configuration with different number of VMs:
 * - Uncoment the configuration bellow for the number of VMs desired. 
 * - Go to the prpl-hypervisor/bare-metal-apps/apps folder and copy the original dhyrstone app. Example:
 * 	cp -R coremark/ coremark2
 * 	cp -R coremark/ coremark3
 * 	cp -R coremark/ coremark4
 * 
 *
 * To compile this example, modify the variable CFG_FILE on the 
 * Makefile to point to this file.
